# Portfolio

I wanted to create a portfolio site that appears minimalistic, but reveals a lot below the surface; a site that is simple but with an element of whimsy and surprise.  Developing this site was a personal challenge in the logistics of layout and CSS.  After many versions, revisions, and possible wrong turns, it is rewarding to see my vision come to life.
